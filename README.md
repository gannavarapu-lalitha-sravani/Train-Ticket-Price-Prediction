# Train-Ticket-Price-Prediction
"Train-Ticket-Price-Prediction" is the process of creating a system that forecasts train ticket costs. The goal of this project is to develop a distributed, scalable system that can effectively handle massive volumes of ticketing data. The project involves utilizing distributed computing frameworks to perform various tasks like feature extraction, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Participants obtain hands-on experience in developing and putting into practice solutions to deal with problems related to large-scale computation, storage, and data processing.

## Predicting train ticket prices offers several advantages:
1.Enhanced Customer Experience

2.Optimized Pricing Strategies

3.Revenue Maximization

4.Data-Driven Decision Making

5.Improved Revenue Forecasting

6.Operational Efficiency

7.Insights for Business Expansion

8.Customer Loyalty and Retention
